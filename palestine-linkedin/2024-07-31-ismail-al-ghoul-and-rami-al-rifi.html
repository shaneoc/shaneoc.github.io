<h1>Ismail al-Ghoul and Rami al-Rifi</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2024-07-31<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7224428082944733184-a4t1" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Another Al Jazeera journalist was assassinated today for doing their job and
trying to tell you things that are important.</p>
<p>There will be a revolution, and I am doing what is required to be included in
the resulting society. If you are not communicating with me, or are otherwise
not clearly in favour of helping the Palestinians, then you are going to have
to justify yourself to me if you want to be included in my world after the
revolution has passed, and I do not feel very sympathetic.</p>

<p>His name was Ismail Al-Ghoul, and on television they are reporting that a
cameraman was killed as well.</p>

<p>The cameraman was Rami al-Refee. This article says they were &quot;in the area
to report from near the Gaza house of Ismail Haniyeh&quot;, which makes it sound
like they were standing in a designated reporting area.</p>

<p>On television they are now showing a destroyed car. They are reporting that
this car is the car that the journalists were inside when they were killed.
This means that these journalists were likely tracked using the location
information from their cellphones, in order to accurately target them with
a drone strike. The car is mobile, so that seems like the most likely
method to me.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Israel has used drones to kill Al Jazeera
journalists in their cars. Here is a relevant article from earlier in the
war:</p>
