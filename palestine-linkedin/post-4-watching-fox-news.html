<h1>Watching Fox News</h1>

<p>Alright so I am currently watching Fox News and they are covering the migrants
crossing the border from Mexico. This is an interesting American political
event as the government seems completely paralyzed. Thankfully the migrants
being interviewed seem nice.</p>
<p>If I have connections on LinkedIn in Pakistan from RapidSilicon you guys should
try to watch streams of Fox News and CNN. I am watching Al Jazeera, so you
should watch Fox News. There is quite a difference. I like the Fox and Friends
hosts in the mornings. Just try not to be terrified about how enthusiastic
people are about bombing the middle east whenever it comes up.</p>
<p>If anybody knows a good English language Israeli television channel I would
definitely watch that, though I am afraid it would be more scary than Fox News
and I wouldn't have anybody here in my apartment to watch it with and freak out
with.</p>

<p>Just in case there is anybody who is not aware, Fox News is well known as the
channel in the US that always supports the Republican party. This means that
whenever Joe Biden comes up they will always say something bad about him. If
you watch MSNBC they will always say something good.</p>
<p>You may have to watch for a while before bombing the middle east comes up.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 2 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Alright so Fox News just had a headline saying New York was a &quot;loser&quot;
state. On Fox News they tend to insult New York and California, because those
states vote for the Democratic Party, while saying nice things about rural
states that vote for the Republican Party.</p>
<p>I think Americans like fighting and so they create reasons to fight. I
find it strange though. What do people in New York think I wonder? Maybe
&quot;loser&quot; is a special code word that is not an insult in the US.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 3 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Alright Americans I promise I am not trying to be insulting, I watch
American media all the time. I am just especially angry given the current
world events. I am hoping that given you call each other losers that you
are just generally not offended easily.</p>
