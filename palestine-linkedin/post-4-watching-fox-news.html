    Watching Fox News

  <p>Alright so I am currently watching Fox News and they are covering the
  migrants crossing the border from Mexico. This is an interesting American
  political event as the government seems completely paralyzed. Thankfully the
  migrants being interviewed seem nice.</p>

  <p>If I have connections on LinkedIn in Pakistan from RapidSilicon you guys
  should try to watch streams of Fox News and CNN. I am watching Al Jazeera, so
  you should watch Fox News. There is quite a difference. I like the Fox and
  Friends hosts in the mornings. Just try not to be terrified about how
  enthusiastic people are about bombing the middle east whenever it comes
  up.</p>

  <p>If anybody knows a good English language Israeli television channel I
  would definitely watch that, though I am afraid it would be more scary than
  Fox News and I wouldn't have anybody here in my apartment to watch it with
  and freak out with.</p>

  <p>Just in case there is anybody who is not aware, Fox News is well known as
  the channel in the US that always supports the Republican party. This means
  that whenever Joe Biden comes up they will always say something bad about
  him. If you watch MSNBC they will always say something good.</p>

  <p>You may have to watch for a while before bombing the middle east comes
  up.</p>

  <p>Alright so Fox News just had a headline saying New York was a "loser"
  state. On Fox News they tend to insult New York and California, because those
  states vote for the Democratic Party, while saying nice things about rural
  states that vote for the Republican Party.</p>

  <p>I think Americans like fighting and so they create reasons to fight. I
  find it strange though. What do people in New York think I wonder? Maybe
  "loser" is a special code word that is not an insult in the US.</p>

  <p>Alright Americans I promise I am not trying to be insulting, I watch
  American media all the time. I am just especially angry given the current
  world events. I am hoping that given you call each other losers that you are
  just generally not offended easily.</p>
