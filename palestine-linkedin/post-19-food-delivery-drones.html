  <h2>
    Food Delivery Drones

  </h2>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>

  <p>I have an idea for a startup. I have been doing research on a few
  different things lately that could be part of a startup:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Radio</li>
    <li>Drones</li>
    <li>Web Development</li>
    <li>Applications for LLMs</li>
    <li>Manufacturing of artificial meat</li>
  </ol>

  <p>I have been investigating these things for various reasons. However, I
  have now realized they could be combined into an awesome startup, which could
  actually probably be used to take over the world.</p>

  <p>I have posted on LinkedIn already about the idea of creating a drone
  swarm, but I was thinking about it incorrectly at first. Before, I was
  thinking these were drones with weapons. But no, that will not work. Instead,
  they should be food delivery drones. That is the way to take over the world.
  Who is in charge, everyone? Is it your government, who taxes you and ignores
  your problems? Or is it the decentralized network of smart people who created
  a world wide drone network that delivers free food anywhere in the world?</p>

  <p>I am thinking the food and drone manufacturing should be totally
  automated. That is how the food can be free. And for artificial meat, I mean
  the real deal, made of animal cells grown in big vats. Why not end the
  killing of animals worldwide as well as ending world hunger at the same time?
  Sounds pretty great to me.</p>

  <p>I am hyping it up because I like the idea and if I do not do it, someone
  should. I want to work on it, but I have this problem of not wanting to be in
  charge because I do not want to be anyone's manager, or lay people off, or
  have to find investors, or worry about money.</p>

  <p>Personally, I think the current government should have a policy that
  provides free food and shelter to the entire population. I need income to pay
  rent. If my food and rent were free, I would simply start creating the
  technology. I think we actually have it backwards when it comes to food and
  rent. If those things were free, I think we would actually have more startups
  and more innovation, because people would be more comfortable taking risks.
  That is how I see it anyway.</p>

  <p>For the record, I have enough money saved to pay rent for a long time.
  However, watching the stock market lately is a bit scary. I feel like rent
  for one apartment is something everyone should get by default, so that
  everyone can stay in their homes regardless of how well the stock market
  does.</p>

  <p>I was thinking maybe there could be a system to set a fair rent for each
  property, and as long as the property is rented to someone for whom it is
  their primary residence, the government pays the owner of the property the
  rental amount. If you live in a property you own, you can just consider it
  rented to yourself, and so you would receive the rental amount directly and
  could use it to pay down a mortgage. If we had a system like this, nobody
  would ever need to be evicted from their primary residence for being unable
  to pay the rent.</p>
