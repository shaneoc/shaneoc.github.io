<h1>Food Delivery Drones</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2025-04-13<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7317167025208860672-RoWH" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have an idea for a startup. I have been doing research on a few different
things lately that could be part of a startup:</p>
<ol>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Drones</li>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Applications for LLMs</li>
<li>Manufacturing of artificial meat</li>
</ol>
<p>I have been investigating these things for various reasons. However, I have now
realized they could be combined into an awesome startup, which could actually
probably be used to take over the world.</p>
<p>I have posted on LinkedIn already about the idea of creating a drone swarm, but
I was thinking about it incorrectly at first. Before, I was thinking these were
drones with weapons. But no, that will not work. Instead, they should be food
delivery drones. That is the way to take over the world.  Who is in charge,
everyone? Is it your government, who taxes you and ignores your problems? Or is
it the decentralized network of smart people who created a world wide drone
network that delivers free food anywhere in the world?</p>
<p>I am thinking the food and drone manufacturing should be totally automated.
That is how the food can be free. And for artificial meat, I mean the real
deal, made of animal cells grown in big vats. Why not end the killing of
animals worldwide as well as ending world hunger at the same time?  Sounds
pretty great to me.</p>
<p>I am hyping it up because I like the idea and if I do not do it, someone
should. I want to work on it, but I have this problem of not wanting to be in
charge because I do not want to be anyone's manager, or lay people off, or have
to find investors, or worry about money.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the current government should have a policy that provides
free food and shelter to the entire population. I need income to pay rent. If
my food and rent were free, I would simply start creating the technology. I
think we actually have it backwards when it comes to food and rent. If those
things were free, I think we would actually have more startups and more
innovation, because people would be more comfortable taking risks. That is how
I see it anyway.</p>

<p>For the record, I have enough money saved to pay rent for a long time.
However, watching the stock market lately is a bit scary. I feel like rent
for one apartment is something everyone should get by default, so that
everyone can stay in their homes regardless of how well the stock market
does.</p>
<p>I was thinking maybe there could be a system to set a fair rent for each
property, and as long as the property is rented to someone for whom it is
their primary residence, the government pays the owner of the property the
rental amount. If you live in a property you own, you can just consider it
rented to yourself, and so you would receive the rental amount directly and
could use it to pay down a mortgage. If we had a system like this, nobody
would ever need to be evicted from their primary residence for being unable
to pay the rent.</p>
