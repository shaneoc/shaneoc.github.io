<h1>World Central Kitchen Workers</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> ~April 2024<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7180902660798078977-o9iJ/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<!-- on 2024-05-30 it said this was posted 1 month ago -->
<p>Israel has now killed 7 aid workers working for World Central Kitchen who were
in Gaza to distribute food. I suspect this killing is a message from Israel for
those from the west who want to help people in Gaza.</p>
<p>One thing that is starting to become clear to me is that there are a large
number of people who believe that those who are in power get there by being
willing to use violence and to hurt people. I suspect there are even smart,
intelligent people who believe this, and so when properly threatened, simply do
what they are told.</p>
<div class="dated-edit">
<div>2024-06-16</div>
<p>I have been considering these words in retrospect. My intent was to
describe these people as having an incorrect strategy. Ideally, people
would not agree to do things simply because they are threatened. Instead,
they would do things because they have been convinced that it makes sense
to do them. By referring to my suspicion that others would do what they
were told if threatened, I was trying to imply that I would not, in order
to inspire others to have the same feeling.</p>
<p>However, after some thought, I have to admit that it is probably literally
true that there is a level of personal threats that could be used to
pressure even the most well-meaning person to do something unethical. The
way I see it, the solution must be to create a society where it is not
possible to threaten people in this way. If you want someone to do
something, they should be convinced, not threatened.</p>
</div>
<p>The ability to use violence is a decision, not a skill. A non-violent person
could theoretically decide to use violence at any time, whereas a skill takes
time to develop and requires effort. If we choose our leaders based on their
ability to use violence and hurt people, then we probably will choose people
who lack any particular skills, and so they probably will not be very good at
their job.</p>
<p>In US politics Joe Biden is well known for using the phrase &quot;don't compare me
to the almighty, compare me to the alternative&quot;. This phrase is an example of
this mindset, in my opinion. When I read the phrase, my interpretation is that
the speaker is saying the listener will choose the speaker because they have no
other option, rather than because the speaker makes ethical decisions as the
almighty theoretically would. In my opinion, this phrase has a subtext that
implies the possible use of violence.</p>
<div class="dated-edit">
<div>2024-06-16</div>
<p>It is possible I am misinterpreting Joe Biden's intent when he uses this
phrase. One of the reasons I have written these additional comments is
because I realized that if a person does not know me very well, they might
think some of my references in this LinkedIn post were a secret call for
violence. If my comments can sometimes be misinterpreted if someone is
looking for a subtle message, so can Joe Biden's. Subtle references are
easy to misinterpret, which is why I decided to post some clarifying
comments.</p>
<p>I disagree with the decisions that Joe Biden is apparently making with
regards to Gaza, but there is a lot of important information I do not have
in order to know how at-fault he really is. People may be lying to him and
manipulating him. I do not know what information he receives. However, I am
very comfortable blaming the system itself. In my opinion, we are all stuck
in a system playing a game with perverse incentives that cause people to
hurt each other for no reason.</p>
<p>The only use of violence that I have intended to imply has been violence
against the physical border walls between Israel and Palestine. That is the
reason that my <a href="../israel-palestine-peace-plan.html">peace plan page</a>
includes an image of a wall exploding.</p>
</div>
<p>Personally my opinion is that humanity will not survive unless every person on
the planet starts refusing to do things that are not in the best interest of
everyone. We have to start ignoring people who believe they are in charge
simply because they are willing to use violence.</p>
<div class="dated-edit">
<div>2024-06-16</div>
<p>This is somewhat of an ironic way to end the LinkedIn post given that in my
comment above I technically just suggested violence against the physical
border walls between Israel and Palestine. However, I am imagining
organized violence, during which humanitarian aid is also rushing through,
and people are not attacking each other.</p>
<p>In my vision I am imagining Pink Floyd playing a concert in the resulting
space, partially because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wall_%E2%80%93_Live_in_Berlin" target="_blank">Roger Waters did the same thing for the Berlin
Wall</a>.
But musical selections would of course be up to the Israelis and
Palestinians.</p>
