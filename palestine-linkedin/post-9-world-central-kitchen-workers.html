  <h2>
    World Central Kitchen Workers
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7180902660798078977-o9iJ/">Original Post</a>, ~April 2024]
  </h2>

  <p>Israel has now killed 7 aid workers working for World Central Kitchen who
  were in Gaza to distribute food. I suspect this killing is a message from
  Israel for those from the west who want to help people in Gaza.</p>

  <p>One thing that is starting to become clear to me is that there are a large
  number of people who believe that those who are in power get there by being
  willing to use violence and to hurt people. I suspect there are even smart,
  intelligent people who believe this, and so when properly threatened, simply
  do what they are told.</p>

  <p>The ability to use violence is a decision, not a skill. A non-violent
  person could theoretically decide to use violence at any time, whereas a
  skill takes time to develop and requires effort. If we choose our leaders
  based on their ability to use violence and hurt people, then we probably will
  choose people who lack any particular skills, and so they probably will not
  be very good at their job.</p>

  <p>In US politics Joe Biden is well known for using the phrase "don't compare
  me to the almighty, compare me to the alternative". This phrase is an example
  of this mindset, in my opinion. When I read the phrase, my interpretation is
  that the speaker is saying the listener will choose the speaker because they
  have no other option, rather than because the speaker makes ethical decisions
  as the almighty theoretically would. In my opinion, this phrase has a subtext
  that implies the possible use of violence.</p>

  <p>Personally my opinion is that humanity will not survive unless every
  person on the planet starts refusing to do things that are not in the best
  interest of everyone. We have to start ignoring people who believe they are
  in charge simply because they are willing to use violence.</p>
