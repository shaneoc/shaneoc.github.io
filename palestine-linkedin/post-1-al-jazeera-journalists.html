  <p>Alright, so I am watching Al Jazeera to keep track of the ongoing events
  in Gaza. I have seen news coverage showing that Israel has been using
  cellphone surveillance to locate Hamas leaders as well as Al Jazeera
  journalists in order to bomb them in their cars using drones.</p>

  <p>Regardless of your thoughts on the justification for these actions,
  wouldn't this represent a risk to the revenue for Apple and Google? For the
  average consumer, I would think they would prefer communication devices where
  this is not possible.</p>

  <p>Additionally, at the moment Israel appears to be on the verge of
  destroying the last remaining city in Gaza. At the moment there are over a
  million people who are already living there in tents. In my opinion, western
  governments should be bringing these people to cities in the west.</p>

  <p>If you are worried about a world war, my thinking is that you want your
  city to have a good ratio of the different groups that are fighting. If you
  have a lot of Palestinian refugees in your city, then that makes your city a
  lot less appealing for an attack, except by Israel. That is why you also want
  your city to have a lot of Israelis as well.</p>

  <p>I personally would be very happy to see a large Palestinian neighborhood
  in Toronto like Chinatown, but with Palestinian restaurants and signs written
  in Arabic.</p>

  <p>The way I see it, the wall between Israel and Gaza has gotta eventually
  come down for humanitarian reasons, and the number of Palestinians that would
  add to Israel makes them uncomfortable. And so I think a good solution is
  that a whole bunch of Palestinians should move to Toronto.  There are direct
  flights between Toronto and Tel Aviv so it is easy to go back and forth. And
  if there are a smaller number of Palestinians in Gaza, Israel will be more
  comfortable taking the wall down.</p>

  <p>Also, personally I find it sexy to date girls with brown skin. I did that
  before and I enjoyed it, and so if a lot of Palestinians move to Toronto then
  that increases the odds of that happening again.</p>

  <p>Well that's not really practical for a number of reasons. Many Israelis
  were born there and have no desire to hurt anyone. I think the Palestinians
  and the Israelis should create a merged identity and just take the wall
  down.</p>
