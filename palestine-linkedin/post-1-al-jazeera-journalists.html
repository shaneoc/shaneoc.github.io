<p>Alright, so I am watching Al Jazeera to keep track of the ongoing events in
Gaza. I have seen news coverage showing that Israel has been using cellphone
surveillance to locate Hamas leaders as well as Al Jazeera journalists in order
to bomb them in their cars using drones.</p>
<p>Regardless of your thoughts on the justification for these actions, wouldn't
this represent a risk to the revenue for Apple and Google? For the average
consumer, I would think they would prefer communication devices where this is
not possible.</p>

<p>Additionally, at the moment Israel appears to be on the verge of destroying
the last remaining city in Gaza. At the moment there are over a million
people who are already living there in tents. In my opinion, western
governments should be bringing these people to cities in the west.</p>
<div class="dated-edit">

<p>After posting this online, I realized that the idea of bringing more
people here might not sound like a good idea to people who are here
already and feel like they are being ignored. We already have homeless
people living in tents.</p>
<p>I have a suggestion in a <a href="2025-04-13-food-delivery-drones.html">later
post</a> about creating a system of
free food and rent for everyone, which I am thinking is how we could
afford to bring people here even if they do not have any money. This
could help homeless people here as well.</p>

<p>If you are worried about a world war, my thinking is that you want your
city to have a good ratio of the different groups that are fighting. If you
have a lot of Palestinian refugees in your city, then that makes your city
a lot less appealing for an attack, except by Israel. That is why you also
want your city to have a lot of Israelis as well.</p>

<p>I personally would be very happy to see a large Palestinian neighborhood in
Toronto like Chinatown, but with Palestinian restaurants and signs written
in Arabic.</p>

<p>The way I see it, the wall between Israel and Gaza has gotta eventually
come down for humanitarian reasons, and the number of Palestinians that
would add to Israel makes them uncomfortable. And so I think a good
solution is that a whole bunch of Palestinians should move to Toronto.
There are direct flights between Toronto and Tel Aviv so it is easy to go
back and forth. And if there are a smaller number of Palestinians in Gaza,
Israel will be more comfortable taking the wall down.</p>

<p>Also, personally I find it sexy to date girls with brown skin. I did that
before and I enjoyed it, and so if a lot of Palestinians move to Toronto
then that increases the odds of that happening again.</p>

<p><span class="not-me">A good solution would be for all of the Jews to move
to the US and give the land back to the Palestinians.</span></p>

<p>Well that's not really practical for a number of reasons. Many Israelis
were born there and have no desire to hurt anyone. I think the Palestinians
and the Israelis should create a merged identity and just take the wall
down.</p>
