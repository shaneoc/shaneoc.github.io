<h1>Reassuring the Palestinians</h1>

<p>I was watching Al Jazeera recently, and I heard a commentator mention that
there were efforts in the US and Canada to convince Palestinians to apply for
visas and come to their country. This commentator was concerned that this was a
tactic to dissolve the Palestinian identity and convince them to abandon their
lands.</p>
<p>I can understand why the Palestinians would be concerned. However, I would
argue that if the Palestinians have more than one home, this is something that
will actually make their identity more difficult to erase.  I think the goal
should be to have some Palestinians move to a small number of western cities,
in large clusters. They should create a Palestinian brand and create
Palestinian neighborhoods. They should make it a cool thing to have in your
city.</p>
<p>The other thing that I think could happen that Palestinians might not realize
is that if there are western cities greeting Palestinians eagerly and wanting
them to move there, this might make Israelis start to want Palestinians to move
to their cities. When many people want a thing it increases its perceived
value.</p>
<p>Since I am genuinely trying to help I really want no part in dissolving the
Palestinian identity. So maybe the best solution is one large cluster in
Toronto, to minimize the chance of that happening.</p>
