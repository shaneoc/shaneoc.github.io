  <h2>
    Reassuring the Palestinians
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7177643604977340416-FVH3/" target="_blank">Original Post</a>, ~March 2024]
  </h2>

  <p>I was watching Al Jazeera recently, and I heard a commentator mention that
  there were efforts in the US and Canada to convince Palestinians to apply for
  visas and come to their country. This commentator was concerned that this was
  a tactic to dissolve the Palestinian identity and convince them to abandon
  their lands.</p>

  <p>I can understand why the Palestinians would be concerned. However, I would
  argue that if the Palestinians have more than one home, this is something
  that will actually make their identity more difficult to erase.  I think the
  goal should be to have some Palestinians move to a small number of western
  cities, in large clusters. They should create a Palestinian brand and create
  Palestinian neighborhoods. They should make it a cool thing to have in your
  city.</p>

  <p>The other thing that I think could happen that Palestinians might not
  realize is that if there are western cities greeting Palestinians eagerly and
  wanting them to move there, this might make Israelis start to want
  Palestinians to move to their cities. When many people want a thing it
  increases its perceived value.</p>

  <p>Since I am genuinely trying to help I really want no part in dissolving
  the Palestinian identity. So maybe the best solution is one large cluster in
  Toronto, to minimize the chance of that happening.</p>
