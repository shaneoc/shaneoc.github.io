    Deciding How to Respond
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7175469467966038017-Fx4Q/" target="_blank">Original Post</a>, ~March 2024]
  </h2>

  <p>For those considering how to personally respond to the events in Gaza, I
  would like to point out that these events are necessarily time-limited, and
  there will at some point be a resolution. Regardless of how things appear at
  the current moment, in the future people will have a more objective view not
  influenced by fear. This is important if you are trying to predict the
  future.</p>

  <p>For those who are living their lives as if nothing is happening, are
  dismissing concerns, and posting normal work posts on LinkedIn, I honestly
  believe you are making a mistake. After these events pass, those who were
  viewed as meaningfully trying to help the people in Gaza will be viewed
  positively and more trustworthy than those who did not. Even if you lose your
  job as a consequence, in the future it will be viewed as a selfless act and
  as a result people are likely to want to hire you again, because they
  perceive you as trustworthy.</p>

  <p>This is how I perceive the situation at least, and is the basis of my
  decision-making. You may disagree with my prediction but I think it is a safe
  bet.</p>

  <p><span class="not-me">Shane, you honestly have no clue what is going on
    there. In this ignorance, you and other people may actually find themselves
    on the wrong side of the history. Not because you want to help people in
    Gaza, but because you do this in a very wrong way.</span></p>

  <p>[LinkedIn Connection #4], I am honestly grateful to see a reply from somebody I know.
  I would actually be very interested in debating the issue with you or anyone
  else if they have a differing view from mine, and have some good points.</p>

  <p>And I am sincere in that I am grateful for your reply. It is difficult to
  express a political opinion on LinkedIn. I have not spoken to you in a while
  and I wish we were in a situation where we could also be doing normal
  non-political socializing.</p>

  <p><span class="not-me">I do think that LinkedIn is not the place for
    political debates. I just had to respond since I miss our work related
    debates ;) Next time you are in Bay Area we should have a debate over a
    beer üçª</span></p>

  <p>[LinkedIn Connection #4] Yeah I understand. I am totally up for a beer sometime with
  you or the others at Intel that I worked with.</p>

  <p>I would visit the Bay Area if not for the fact that I am not making any
  income and therefore cannot afford the tickets. Just want to put that hint
  out there for anyone who might be reading this message.</p>
