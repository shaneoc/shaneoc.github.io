<h1>Baofeng UV-5R</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2024-09-17<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7241831597618925569-ifpZ" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>On Al Jazeera they are now reporting that an attack has been performed on
Hezbollah members in Lebanon that caused hundreds of pagers to explode
simultaneously. They are reporting that 1,200 people have been injured. I have
not heard of any deaths, but some people have lost their fingers. I believe I
heard them report that the devices were somewhat new and were purchased in the
last year, though I am not completely sure.</p>
<p>On my website, below the Al Jazeera feed on the homepage, I have a suggestion
that people buy the Baofeng UV-5R:</p>

<p>It is not really a replacement for a smartphone, but at least with amateur
radio it is easier to build your own device that you can be sure does not
contain an explosive mechanism or surveillance device, and it does not require
a central tower.</p>

<p>By the way, I do not consider myself an amateur radio expert, so maybe an
expert would suggest a different device. However this is the one I bought,
and so I have the programming cable and software.</p>

<p>Also, technically you are supposed to have a license to transmit on amateur
radio frequencies. I personally do not have a license, but I like the idea
of building my own radio, and it seems like people who build their own
radios usually use amateur radio. I intend to get a license before
transmitting, unless there is an emergency of some kind before then where
it would be useful.</p>

<p>Al Jazeera is now reporting eight people killed and 2,750 people wounded by
the exploding pagers</p>

<p>Al Jazeera is now reporting that there has been a second wave of explosions
today, however this time handheld radios similar to the one I suggested
above were targeted. This is obviously concerning.</p>
<p>These explosions seem designed to injure and scare the general population
in Lebanon, and so I would call this a terrorist attack. It appears that it
was likely Israel that did the attack. On my LinkedIn wall, I have posted
about the events in Gaza and have been critical of the things Israel is
doing. Should I be concerned that the amateur radios that I have purchased
will explode? They probably will not, but at the same time I do not
understand the limits of this game.</p>
<p>Right now, the mindset I have is that a possible way to solve the problem
is to create an alternate Internet with some kind of open source mesh radio
network, with an alternate world government and election system, and
alternate currency. Reasonable people will prefer to use a reasonable
system, and most people are reasonable people. If this alternate system is
popular enough, then it should have enough influence to dictate to real
world governments what to do.</p>
<p>If this system actually already exists, then those that are in the system,
please include the rest of us.</p>
