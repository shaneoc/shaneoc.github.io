<h1>Deciding How to Respond</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2024-03-18<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7175469467966038017-Fx4Q/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<!-- on 2024-05-30 it said this was posted 2 months ago -->
<p>For those considering how to personally respond to the events in Gaza, I would
like to point out that these events are necessarily time-limited, and there
will at some point be a resolution. Regardless of how things appear at the
current moment, in the future people will have a more objective view not
influenced by fear. This is important if you are trying to predict the future.</p>
<p>For those who are living their lives as if nothing is happening, are dismissing
concerns, and posting normal work posts on LinkedIn, I honestly believe you are
making a mistake. After these events pass, those who were viewed as
meaningfully trying to help the people in Gaza will be viewed positively and
more trustworthy than those who did not. Even if you lose your job as a
consequence, in the future it will be viewed as a selfless act and as a result
people are likely to want to hire you again, because they perceive you as
trustworthy.</p>
<p>This is how I perceive the situation at least, and is the basis of my
decision-making. You may disagree with my prediction but I think it is a safe
bet.</p>

<p><span class="not-me">Shane, you honestly have no clue what is going on
there.  In this ignorance, you and other people may actually find
themselves on the wrong side of the history. Not because you want to help
people in Gaza, but because you do this in a very wrong way.</span></p>

<p><strong>Reply 2 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>[LinkedIn Connection #4], I am honestly grateful to see a reply from
somebody I know. I would actually be very interested in debating the issue
with you or anyone else if they have a differing view from mine, and have
some good points.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 3 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>And I am sincere in that I am grateful for your reply. It is difficult to
express a political opinion on LinkedIn. I have not spoken to you in a
while and I wish we were in a situation where we could also be doing normal
non-political socializing.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 4 - <span class="not-me">LinkedIn Connection #4</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="not-me">I do think that LinkedIn is not the place for
political debates. I just had to respond since I miss our work related
debates ;) Next time you are in Bay Area we should have a debate over a
beer 🍻</span></p>

<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 5 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>[LinkedIn Connection #4] Yeah I understand. I am totally up for a beer
sometime with you or the others at Intel that I worked with.</p>
<p>I would visit the Bay Area if not for the fact that I am not making any
income and therefore cannot afford the tickets. Just want to put that hint
out there for anyone who might be reading this message.</p>
