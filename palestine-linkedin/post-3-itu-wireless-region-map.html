<p>These are ITU wireless regulation regions. Sure is funny how that boundary
between region 1 and 3 is a funny shape, just the right shape to cleanly
divide the world's Muslim region.</p>

<p>And I cannot help but notice that on my Teksavvy television service, Al
Jazeera has their volume turned down lower than the other news services.
Why is that I wonder?</p>

<p>The people doing this kind of stuff are the holy war people. Those are the
ones in charge of the US right now.</p>

<p>I really do not understand the bully mentality. Some people seem to be
aroused by teaming up, finding people who cannot fight back, and then
hurting those people.</p>

<p>Oh yeah I have another example of anti-Muslim racism. I put a Palestinian
flag on the door of my apartment and wrote some messages describing how
people were being killed and left those on the floor in the hallway. The
building management immediately called the police without interacting with
me at all, and wrote an official letter describing how I was being
threatening, so that they could use the letter as evidence in order to
evict me later.</p>

<p>I am feeling an incredible amount of empathy towards the Palestinians right
now, with them having their houses exploded, entire families killed, etc. I
can clearly see that the US government is racist against Muslims.  Trump
literally proposed a Muslim ban in the US. And probably democracy does not
really exist there, for a number of reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 7 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Like how is this problem actually solved? If the leadership in the west is
a bunch of dictators that are over in the middle east killing people for no
reason, what should those of us here do? I put the Palestinian flag on the
door, got in trouble etc. But like, what will actually work?</p>

<p><strong>Reply 8 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>This is one reason I think we should bring lots of Palestinians to Toronto
and Ontario. If there are a lot of Palestinians living here it will be a
lot more difficult for the government to get away with being racist against
them, at least in Canada. And we are not far from the Muslim region of the
US which seems to be Michigan.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 9 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I suppose they could move directly to the US to influence politics there,
that's another option. But I live in Toronto and I like them so I want them
to move here. They would be a more significant voting block in Canada since
they would represent a greater share of the population, if they moved here.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 10 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>By the way, I only partially blame Israel for what is happening. The
government in Israel is putting their own people in danger on behalf of the
US government. People can get very influenced by what is profitable for
them and the US is sending them billions of dollars that they are required
to spend on the military. That is quite an incentive. I wonder what would
happen if the US instead sent them billions of dollars for a space program?</p>

<p><span class="not-me">Seems like an odd flex. My first impression was that
Russia lobbied to be grouped with Europe instead of Asia. But it seems more
likely this just grew out of how RF bandwidth usage was evolving
regionally, then some order imposed to reduce the chaos.</span></p>
