  <p>These are ITU wireless regulation regions. Sure is funny how that boundary
  between region 1 and 3 is a funny shape, just the right shape to cleanly
  divide the world's Muslim region.</p>

  <p>And I cannot help but notice that on my Teksavvy television service, Al
  Jazeera has their volume turned down lower than the other news services.  Why
  is that I wonder?</p>

  <p>The people doing this kind of stuff are the holy war people. Those are the
  ones in charge of the US right now.</p>

  <p>I really do not understand the bully mentality. Some people seem to be
  aroused by teaming up, finding people who cannot fight back, and then hurting
  those people.</p>

  <p>Oh yeah I have another example of anti-Muslim racism. I put a Palestinian
  flag on the door of my apartment and wrote some messages describing how
  people were being killed and left those on the floor in the hallway. The
  building management immediately called the police without interacting with me
  at all, and wrote an official letter describing how I was being threatening,
  so that they could use the letter as evidence in order to evict me later.</p>

  <p>I am feeling an incredible amount of empathy towards the Palestinians
  right now, with them having their houses exploded, entire families killed,
  etc. I can clearly see that the US government is racist against Muslims.
  Trump literally proposed a Muslim ban in the US. And probably democracy does
  not really exist there, for a number of reasons.</p>

  <p>Like how is this problem actually solved? If the leadership in the west is
  a bunch of dictators that are over in the middle east killing people for no
  reason, what should those of us here do? I put the Palestinian flag on the
  door, got in trouble etc. But like, what will actually work?</p>

  <p>This is one reason I think we should bring lots of Palestinians to Toronto
  and Ontario. If there are a lot of Palestinians living here it will be a lot
  more difficult for the government to get away with being racist against them,
  at least in Canada. And we are not far from the Muslim region of the US which
  seems to be Michigan.</p>

  <p>I suppose they could move directly to the US to influence politics there,
  that's another option. But I live in Toronto and I like them so I want them
  to move here. They would be a more significant voting block in Canada since
  they would represent a greater share of the population, if they moved
  here.</p>

  <p>By the way, I only partially blame Israel for what is happening. The
  government in Israel is putting their own people in danger on behalf of the
  US government. People can get very influenced by what is profitable for them
  and the US is sending them billions of dollars that they are required to
  spend on the military. That is quite an incentive. I wonder what would happen
  if the US instead sent them billions of dollars for a space program?</p>

  <p><span class="not-me">Seems like an odd flex. My first impression was that
    Russia lobbied to be grouped with Europe instead of Asia. But it seems more
    likely this just grew out of how RF bandwidth usage was evolving
    regionally, then some order imposed to reduce the chaos.</span></p>
