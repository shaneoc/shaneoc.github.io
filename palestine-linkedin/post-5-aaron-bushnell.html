  <p>Apparently a US soldier has now committed suicide by lightning himself on
  fire outside the Israeli embassy in Washington, as a protest over the war in
  Gaza.</p>

  <p>I feel like there are many of us who are outraged and are surrounded by
  many people who are strangely unconcerned.</p>

  <p>This event with the US soldier was reported in the Canadian media but I
  have not yet seen it reported on CNN or Fox News, which I have been watching
  often. It was reported very often on Al Jazeera.</p>
