  <h2>
    Manipulating People Ethically
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7176215799467028480-3A9L/" target="_blank">Original Post</a>, ~March 2024]
  </h2>

  <p>If others are thinking about the Gaza issue like I am, they are trying to
  think of how people can be manipulated into doing the right thing, in an
  ethical way.</p>

  <p>As an outsider, when I think about Israel and Palestine, my feeling is
  they are eventually going to end up with something like a mini European Union
  with only two countries, or something like Northern Ireland, where there is a
  political boundary but no physical border.</p>

  <p>I think the Israelis need to be manipulated into wanting the Palestinians
  to be included in their identity. They have lived next to them for their
  entire existence and they know the Palestinians better than they know the
  people in the rest of the middle east. If they were gone, a part of the
  Israeli identity would be gone, because a part of the Israeli identity is
  fighting with the Palestinians.</p>

  <p>Personally, I like the Palestinians. In earlier posts I mentioned that I
  want to bring a bunch of them to Toronto. We already have a large Chinatown.
  It would be really cool if Toronto had a big Palestinian neighborhood as
  well, with Palestinian restaurants, signs in Arabic, and people who will
  empathize with me when I want to rant about how unfair the world is.</p>

  <p>One thing that is cool about living in a city with a lot of immigrants is
  that there are more options for interesting people to meet when you are
  dating. What has happened to me is that I dated a girl in Toronto with brown
  skin, and now I find that very attractive. Of course, living in Toronto, I
  should mention that obviously Asian girls are sexy as well. It would just be
  really cool if we all had another race to choose from on the dating apps. We
  do not have enough brown people in Toronto. This is why the relationship
  between Toronto and the Palestinians is so important.</p>
