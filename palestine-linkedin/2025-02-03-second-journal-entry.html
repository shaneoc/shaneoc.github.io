<h1>Second Journal Entry</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2025-02-03<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7292143980761202688-gG7c" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have added another journal entry to my website:</p>
<p><a href="../journal/2025-02-03-the-time-i-was-hacked.html">2025-02-03-the-time-i-was-hacked.html</a></p>
<p>This journal entry has three parts. The first part describes an experience I
had a few years ago where I truly believe that my computers were hacked or
remotely accessed. I think it is an interesting story, and I am hoping the
story draws people in and convinces them to read the entire page. I thought
carefully when writing the descriptions and I tried to be as accurate as
possible based on what I can remember.</p>
<p>The second part is on an Intel paper that was published online a few years ago
on some work that I did. There is a story around this paper that I explain on
the page. If you read the whole thing you will understand my situation a lot
better.</p>

<p>I am trying to find a social group that understands my situation. I have
experienced a lot of hostility from people and I do not understand the
reason why. Your posts, for example, seem somewhat hostile to me. You
commented on my last post in order to criticize it, and then when I
explained myself, you deleted your reply. My perception is that people who
know me are communicating amongst themselves and it does not appear they
are saying positive things.</p>
<p>I am concerned that someone who does not know me very well might become
involved in these hidden conversations without giving me the opportunity to
give my side of the story. I want people to understand that if they hear
something negative about me, it is possible that they may be hearing
something that is not true. By giving this paper as an example, it makes
people more likely to believe me if I claim that some people are treating
me unfairly.</p>
<p>I would rather resolve the issue with the people involved and have a
positive relationship with them. If I sue them, this will be less likely to
occur.</p>

<p>For the record, however, I appreciate that you replied to my posts even if
your last post seemed a little hostile. You might not be the only person
who has the same opinion as you and I want to be able to respond to what
you and others might be thinking.</p>

<p>Yeah that makes sense, I think a lot of people see things that way as well.
I am trying to be careful what I say. I am hoping that after some time
passes, people will think about it and decide that I did not say anything
too bad.</p>
<p>As for unemployment I honestly am seriously hoping that we might be on the
verge of an AI singularity. It seems like it would be very likely that it
would come with basic income for everyone. It seems like it might not be
that far away.</p>
