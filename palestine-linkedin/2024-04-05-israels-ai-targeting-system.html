<h1>Israel's AI Targeting System</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2024-04-05<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7182007304198713344-DseD/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<!-- on 2024-05-30 it said this was posted 1 month ago -->
<p>I just read <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/03/israel-gaza-ai-database-hamas-airstrikes" target="_blank">this
article</a>
in the Guardian about Lavender, the AI system used by Israel to choose
bombing targets in Gaza. If you work in AI, I recommend you read the article,
because this could have a material impact on the profitablity of your
business.</p>
<p>The system described in the article consists of multiple parts. First
there is the surveillance, which was used to generate a list of 37,000
targets. It is not specified in the article how this surveillance was done,
but I would imagine AI algorithms were used to process the raw data. This
would mean things like speech-to-text algorithms and algorithms that can
interpret language in order to determine what is being said in an automated
way. Given the state of technology in the world I would be surprised if
Israel did not have some method of obtaining access to the cellphone of every
Palestinian in order to retrieve the raw data from emails and the
microphone.</p>
<p>The second part of the system is the selection of targets. This is covered
in detail in the Guardian article. Unfortunately, this system is necessarily
dependent on statistics. From the article we can see they have measured a 90%
accuracy rate in their predictions, which is considered acceptable for their
use case. Additionally, the system provides the operator with a control to
limit the number of civilian casualties where are acceptable per strike. In
this case, it appears they have configured the system for 10 to 100
casualties per strike, depending on the political situation at the time of
the strike, and the emotional state of the Israeli leaders.</p>
<p>I am personally opposed to almost every aspect of this system. I
personally think even the Hamas members deserve trials and I do not believe
in capital punishment. However, regardless of that, I think this system is
not sustainable. If you are trying to predict the future, this is important.
I think this technology is so dangerous that I cannot see a realistic future
timeline that does not involve regulating technology around the world to
prevent people from creating these kinds of systems. If we do not regulate
it, we get destroyed, and so that timeline is unlikely from a business
perspective.</p>
<p>If it is inevitable that it will be regulated, then maybe the tech
industry should get started on figuring out what the solution will be. Any
company that participates in the solution will have a say in the form the
solution takes, and can better protect their interests.</p>

<p>I probably should have linked the original article that the Guardian got
the information from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/" target="_blank">https://www.972mag.com/lavender-ai-israeli-army-gaza/</a></p>
<p>This appears to be an Israeli publication. I am pleased to read articles by
like-minded Israelis.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 2 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Alright, I just finished reading the article at the +972 website. It is
quite long but worth reading. I have never heard of this publication
before, but the Guardian is describing it as an Israeli-Palestinian
publication, and the author lives in Jerusalem. There are references to
multiple Israeli military officers expressing regret for what has occurred.</p>
<p>In my opinion it is important for peace that people can see that there are
others on the opposing side that do not want to cause harm and are able to
empathize with the situation of the other side. The Israelis that admitted
feeling regret in this article did a brave thing that helps Israel in my
opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 3 - <span class="not-me">LinkedIn Connection #6</span></strong></p>
<p><span class="not-me">Completely agree. This tech has been in development
for many many years by many of the same companies that pioneered AI and
autonomous driving (in particular). It has also always been for
surveillance, weapons and killing. The industry has know and either turned
a blind eye, or knowingly supported it.</span></p>
<p><span class="not-me">I’m glad that people are finally being heard when they
speak out. Responsibility, representation and regulation of AI are needed
now. Thank you for highlighting this and sharing your thought.</span></p>
