<h1>Manipulating People Ethically</h1>

<p>If others are thinking about the Gaza issue like I am, they are trying to think
of how people can be manipulated into doing the right thing, in an ethical way.</p>
<p>As an outsider, when I think about Israel and Palestine, my feeling is they are
eventually going to end up with something like a mini European Union with only
two countries, or something like Northern Ireland, where there is a political
boundary but no physical border.</p>
<p>I think the Israelis need to be manipulated into wanting the Palestinians to be
included in their identity. They have lived next to them for their entire
existence and they know the Palestinians better than they know the people in
the rest of the middle east. If they were gone, a part of the Israeli identity
would be gone, because a part of the Israeli identity is fighting with the
Palestinians.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the Palestinians. In earlier posts I mentioned that I want
to bring a bunch of them to Toronto. We already have a large Chinatown. It
would be really cool if Toronto had a big Palestinian neighborhood as well,
with Palestinian restaurants, signs in Arabic, and people who will empathize
with me when I want to rant about how unfair the world is.</p>
<p>One thing that is cool about living in a city with a lot of immigrants is that
there are more options for interesting people to meet when you are dating. What
has happened to me is that I dated a girl in Toronto with brown skin, and now I
find that very attractive. Of course, living in Toronto, I should mention that
obviously Asian girls are sexy as well. It would just be really cool if we all
had another race to choose from on the dating apps. We do not have enough brown
people in Toronto. This is why the relationship between Toronto and the
Palestinians is so important.</p>
