<h1>Drone Defense Systems</h1>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have been posting about Palestine and one of my personal goals has been to
make friends with people who share my concerns about the issue.</p>
<p>I can see by watching the news that drones are becoming an important component
of the war on Ukraine and the war on Palestine and Lebanon. By watching the
news, it also appears to be the case that modern military air defense systems
are unable to stop small drones. In Israel, Hezbollah has been able to fly
drones in Israeli air space for hours before they are caught.</p>
<p>Additionally, apparently the people in Ukraine are in the process of
manufacturing millions of small drones called FPV drones, which are kamikaze
drones designed to fly into a person and explode. From what I understand, is it
possible to manufacture small drones like this using a normal consumer 3D
printer.</p>
<p>My feeling is that humanity will need a drone surveillance and defense system
that covers the entire planet to keep people safe from these small drones.
Unfortunately, in the meantime, it appears that there will be a period of time
where many people are able to manufacture the drones, while the defense systems
do not fully exist yet. I find this somewhat alarming, and it seems like
something that requires a solution quickly.</p>
<p>I am interested in working on defense systems for small drones. It anybody else
is interested in this topic, please feel free to message me.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 1 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I think I should comment on my use of the word &quot;on&quot; when describing wars in
Ukraine, Palestine, and Lebanon. Personally, for each of these conflicts I
have a lot of sympathy for the group which I perceive to be less powerful,
with the war largely on their territory. In Israel, however, I am sure the
opinion is largely that they were attacked first on October 7, and so they
might prefer to describe it as a war on Israel.</p>
<p>As someone who does not want to be droned, I do not want either side to be
angry at me.</p>
<p>I have personally read a lot about the history of Israel and Palestine. In
my opinion, there is an important distinction between the state of Israel
and the Jewish people who have indeed lived in the middle east for a very
long time. My understanding is that when the state of Israel was formed,
the people who created the state encouraged Jewish people from across the
Ottoman Empire to concentrate there, and they sometimes used violence in
order to accomplish that. In that case, that would make Jewish people the
victims and makes it understandable why they would seek a Greater Israel in
order to return to these areas. I think a key problem is the lack of
communication between the sides.</p>
