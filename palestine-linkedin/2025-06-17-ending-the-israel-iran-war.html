<h1>Ending the Israel-Iran War</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> 2025-06-17<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7340717298724368384-rgiQ" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I am making a public disclosure of part of my proposal for ending the war
between Israel and Iran. I am proposing that a middle east union be created
that works in a similar way to the European Union, with a directly elected
parliament. Egypt should be permitted to simultaneously be a member of the
African Union as well as the middle east union, and Turkey should be permitted
to simultaneously be a member of the European Union as well as the middle east
union.</p>
<p>I have proposed this idea elsewhere, however I wanted to record this idea
publicly in an official location, so that I can claim credit in the future.</p>
<p>Thank you, that is all.</p>

<p>I am assuming that Israel and Iran would be member states of the middle
east union. This is a key part of why it would bring peace.</p>
<p>If the middle east union extends as far as Pakistan, then I think Pakistan
should be permitted to simultaneously be a member state of the middle east
union, as well as a union with India if one were created in the future.</p>

<p>I am thinking of this post as something somewhat like a patent. I tried to
write it in a way such that it gave some specific instructions for an
actual solution to the problem, but also tried to be as general as possible
so that it would be difficult for the actual politicians to solve the
problem without solving it the way I specified.</p>
<p>I can understand why it might be annoying that I mentioned that I want to
claim credit, however I am trying to create this association that the post
is kind of like a patent, and being able to brag about it in the future is
the reward. The patent system is annoying but it is supposed to be a system
that rewards people for thinking of good ideas and publicly disclosing
them. If others posted similar posts trying to solve other world problems
I would not find it annoying.</p>

<p>I am reading my own post and it starts with &quot;I am making a public
disclosure&quot; and it annoys me to read that because it sounds like I am
arbitrarily using a weird phrase, but public disclosure is actually the
phrase lawyers use. Anyway all that really matters is that I wrote the idea
somewhere.</p>
<p>If they actually make a political union in the middle east I think that
would be cool and I would visit.</p>
