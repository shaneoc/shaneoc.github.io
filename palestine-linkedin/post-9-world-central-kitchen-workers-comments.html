  <h2>
    World Central Kitchen Workers (comments)
    [<a href="post-9-world-central-kitchen-workers.html">back</a>]
  </h2>

  <p>This LinkedIn post discusses violence, and after re-reading the original
  post I decided that I wanted to provide some clarifying comments, since this
  is an important topic.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">&gt; Israel has now killed 7 aid
  workers working for World Central Kitchen who were in Gaza to distribute
  food. I suspect this killing is a message from Israel for those from the west
  who want to help people in Gaza.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">&gt; One thing that is starting to
  become clear to me is that there are a large number of people who believe
  that those who are in power get there by being willing to use violence and to
  hurt people. I suspect there are even smart, intelligent people who believe
  this, and so when properly threatened, simply do what they are told.</p>

  <span class="reply-header">Comment</span>

  <p>I have been considering this comment in retrospect. My intent was to
  describe these people as having an incorrect strategy. Ideally, people would
  not agree to do things simply because they are threatened. Instead, they
  would do things because they have been convinced that it makes sense to do
  them. By referring to my suspicion that others would do what they were told
  if threatened, I was trying to imply that I would not, in order to inspire
  others to have the same feeling.</p>

  <p>However, after some thought, I have to admit that it is probably literally
  true that there is a level of personal threats that could be used to pressure
  even the most well-meaning person to do something unethical. The way I see
  it, the solution must be to create a society where it is not possible to
  threaten people in this way. If you want something to do something, they
  should be convinced, not threatened.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">&gt; The ability to use violence is a
  decision, not a skill. A non-violent person could theoretically decide to use
  violence at any time, whereas a skill takes time to develop and requires
  effort. If we choose our leaders based on their ability to use violence and
  hurt people, then we probably will choose people who lack any particular
  skills, and so they probably will not be very good at their job.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">&gt; In US politics Joe Biden is well
  known for using the phrase "don't compare me to the almighty, compare me to
  the alternative". This phrase is an example of this mindset, in my opinion.
  When I read the phrase, my interpretation is that the speaker is saying the
  listener will choose the speaker because they have no other option, rather
  than because the speaker makes ethical decisions as the almighty
  theoretically would. In my opinion, this phrase has a subtext that implies
  the possible use of violence.</p>

  <p>It is possible I am misinterpreting Joe Biden's intent. One of the reasons
  I have written these additional comments is because I realized that if a
  person does not know me very well, they might think some of my references in
  this LinkedIn post were a secret call for violence. Subtle references are
  easy to misinterpret, which is why I decided to post some clarifying
  comments.</p>

  <p>I disagree with the decisions that Joe Biden is apparently making with
  regards to Gaza, but there is a lot of important information I do not have in
  order to know how at-fault he really is. People may be lying to him and
  manipulating him. I do not know what information he receives. However, I am
  very comfortable blaming the system itself. In my opinion, we are all stuck
  in a system playing a game with perverse incentives that cause people to
  hurt each other for no reason.</p>

  <p>The only violence that I have intended to imply has been violence against
  the physical border walls between Israel and Palestine.</p>

  <p style="background-color: #EEEEEE;">&gt; Personally my opinion is that humanity will not survive unless every
  person on the planet starts refusing to do things that are not in the best
  interest of everyone. We have to start ignoring people who believe they are
  in charge simply because they are willing to use violence.</p>
