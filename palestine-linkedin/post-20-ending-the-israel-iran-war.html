  <h2>
    Ending the Israel-Iran War
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7340717298724368384-rgiQ" target="_blank">Original Post</a>, June 17, 2025]
  </h2>

  <p>Hello everyone,</p>

  <p>I am making a public disclosure of part of my proposal for ending the war
  between Israel and Iran. I am proposing that a middle east union be created
  that works in a similar way to the European Union, with a directly elected
  parliament. Egypt should be permitted to simultaneously be a member of the
  African Union as well as the middle east union, and Turkey should be
  permitted to simultaneously be a member of the European Union as well as the
  middle east union.</p>

  <p>I have proposed this idea elsewhere, however I wanted to record this idea
  publicly in an official location, so that I can claim credit in the future.</p>

  <p>Thank you, that is all.</p>

  <p>Shane</p>

  <p>I am assuming that Israel and Iran would be member states of the middle
  east union. This is a key part of why it would bring peace.</p>

  <p>If the middle east union extends as far as Pakistan, then I think Pakistan
  should be permitted to simultaneously be a member state of the middle east
  union, as well as a union with India if one were created in the future.</p>

  <p>I am thinking of this post as something somewhat like a patent. I tried
  to write it in a way such that it gave some specific instructions for an
  actual solution to the problem, but also tried to be as general as possible
  so that it would be difficult for the actual politicians to solve the
  problem without solving it the way I specified.</p>

  <p>I can understand why it might be annoying that I mentioned that I want to
  claim credit, however I am trying to create this association that the post
  is kind of like a patent, and being able to brag about it in the future is
  the reward. The patent system is annoying but it is supposed to be a system
  that rewards people for thinking of good ideas and publicly disclosing them.
  If others posted similar posts trying to solve other world problems I
  would not find it annoying.</p>

  <p>I am reading my own post and it starts with "I am making a public
  disclosure" and it annoys me to read that because it sounds like I am
  arbitrarily using a weird phrase, but public disclosure is actually the
  phrase lawyers use. Anyway all that really matters is that I wrote the idea
  somewhere.</p>

  <p>If they actually make a political union in the middle east I think that
  would be cool and I would visit.</p>
