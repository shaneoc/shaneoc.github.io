    Public Letter to Bob Rae
    [<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7186299867659415552-89Gj/">Original Post</a>, ~April 2024]
  </h2>

  <p>Hello,</p>

  <p>I am attempting to contact Bob Rae, the ambassador of Canada to the UN. I
  am a Canadian citizen.</p>

  <p>I have been watching the war on Gaza for months. There appears to be an
  area of land that two different societies wish to occupy. Logically, the
  only possible solutions are for one of them to move, or to take the walls
  down and create one unified area. In practice, however, it seems nearly
  impossible for one of them to move. Therefore, what we will definitely be
  doing is something like a mini European Union with two countries in it,
  or like Northern Ireland, with no physical border infrastructure.</p>

  <p>I have a suspicion that international politics is somewhat like a normal
  workplace in that there are accepted norms for who makes suggestions. I
  have myself found that in the past that managers do not like it when
  their reports make suggestions for the entire team. In the workplace this
  can cause some inefficiencies, as the emotional resistance to taking the
  suggestion of the employee can cause the manager to delay solving the
  problem for a very long time.</p>

  <p>In this case, however, the delay of politicians in order to satisfy their
  ego is actually very significant. Sometimes it is understandable when it
  takes a while to realize what you should do. However, every day that the
  solution has been presented to you without you solving it is another day
  of killing that you are responsible for causing.</p>

  <p>Upon re-reading my post I realize that I may need to apologize to the
  people of Ukraine for not posting this message in support of them a long
  time ago. The letter works perfectly for their case as well if you
  replace the word Gaza with Ukraine.</p>

  <p>Do we have to overthrow our governments? How do we start? What is the
  first step? I have been thinking about the best way to do this.
  Unfortunately the urgency of the problems in Gaza and Ukraine seem to
  suggest that solutions that work quickly are preferred.</p>

  <p>Since I did just specifically reference overthrowing the government, I
  might as well provide a few more details so you know I do not mean a
  scary thing.</p>

  <p>I think we should have a new worldwide currency that is printed by some
  central agency which will distribute the money more fairly around the
  world, rather than giving it mostly to the west and leaving many other
  places in poverty. If the existing governments do not participate we
  simply create the currency anyway and ignore them. Eventually our
  currency is so influential that what we think is more important than what
  the current governments think, and so we ignore them unless they are
  participating.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately, building a new currency will take a long time and we have
  this problem of urgency created by the situations in Gaza and Ukraine, as
  well as Sudan and all those other places where people are dying and the
  government does not care.</p>

  <p>To solve the problem of urgency, right now I am thinking public protests
  are good, and sending messages online. I have personally messaged several
  ambassadors to explain that my government does not represent me when it
  comes to our lack of response on the issue of Gaza. If enough people send
  those messages, it may actually bring into question the legitimacy of our
  governments internationally since so many of their own citizens disagree
  with the government. This might motivate them to change their position.</p>

  <p>Unfortunately we also have this problem of universal surveillance, where
  literally everything we do on our phones is probably recorded somewhere
  for the government to inspect. This creates an incentive for people to
  hide their true feelings out of concern for retribution. I understand
  this concern, and I have personally decided to take the risk. I am trying
  my best to always propose solutions which are in the best interest of
  everyone, so that even if I am surveilled, there should not be any group
  that feels like I am attacking them specifically.</p>

  <p>I have mentioned the US government as a target a bunch of times, but I
  think they can take it. They are the big scary government and even in US
  media they portray the federal government as scary. I think the US
  federal government should just voluntarily let us overthrow them, and
  then Hollywood can make a shitload of money on the movies that could be
  made.</p>
