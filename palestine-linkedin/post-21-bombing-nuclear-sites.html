    Bombing Nuclear Sites

  <p>I hope I have connections that are experts on physics.</p>

  <p>This wired article describes the attack on Iran's Fordow nuclear site.
  Large bombs were dropped on the ventilator shafts. The way the article is
  written, it sounds like both the US government and the writers of the wired
  article believe that it is possible to destroy uranium with a bomb. However,
  my understanding is that it is not possible to destroy uranium unless it is
  converted to another element as part of a nuclear reaction. If you tried to
  blow it up, you would instead just scatter it around. Can anyone confirm if I
  am correct?</p>

  <p>If I am correct, it seems pretty scary that the US government bombed the
  ventilator shafts, which seems to me like it could open them and cause the
  nuclear material to be released. Iran claims to have removed all of the
  nuclear material before the site was bombed, so it might not be a problem,
  but it is still pretty scary I think.</p>

  <p>This line from the article makes it seem like the uranium was expected to
  be bombed directly:</p>

  <p>"There’s also the possibility that Iran was able to move nuclear material
  out of the facility before the attack, limiting the bombing’s
  usefulness."</p>
