    After the Revolution

  <p>[renamed from <a href="post-2-new-world-order.html">New World Order</a>]</p>

  <p>Alright, I have been doing a lot of thinking about the new world order
  after the revolution. I kinda want to give suggestions, but my understanding
  of executive culture is that you are not supposed to admit when I am correct
  about anything, which unfortunately means that you cannot solve problems when
  I point them out.</p>

  <p>I did want to point out one thing that occurred to me though. When you pay
  someone a salary, they have an incentive to go slower, because the same task
  done more slowly causes them to be paid more for the task. When you do not
  pay someone any salary at all, however, they have an incentive to go faster
  otherwise they will be evicted.</p>

  <p>I just want a nice office like they got at the Google headquarters, with a
  good team, and I am willing to go super slow on any task. Though honestly I'm
  increasingly feeling like I want to choose all the tasks myself and they
  should be for fun.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 2 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>Well some things it would be difficult to go extremely slow because I will
  want the thing itself, and sometimes it will be unethical to go slow. But
  yeah other than that I want lots of time to sit on the couch and smoke
  weed.</p>

  <p>Also can I possibly have three girlfriends? I am afraid of seeming a bit
  selfish, but I am thinking that we will be like a family and do stuff
  together, and if it was only two girlfriends we could not easily play
  tennis.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 4 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>In fact I am pretty sure my own subconscious specifically told me to ask
  for three girlfriends. I am not sure why but I am supposed to ask for
  three.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <p>And they must be biological women since these would be potential sexual
  partners. However I do enjoy the idea of also doing engineering work with
  them.</p>

  <p>Alright maybe this is strange content for LinkedIn but I am kind of losing
  my mind here in my apartment watching the news and realizing how the world
  works.</p>

  <p>Like do we have some kind of holy war going on that's part of the
  subconscious world that is just now becoming apparent? Why are the US and
  Israel purposefully starting a war?</p>

  <p>Apparently the west is an evil warmongering place that has been tormenting
  the middle east probably for religious reasons or for oil, and somehow I
  thought it was just a difficult problem and everyone was trying their best to
  solve it.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">
  <hr>
  <span class="reply-header">Reply 9 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>The politicians from the west are going to the middle east just to keep
  the politicians there under their control, rather than trying to solve
  anything</p>

  <p>When engineers go slow to save their job, the product comes out later or
  is more expensive. When politicians go slow to save their job, they drop
  bombs and create society-wide problems on purpose.</p>

  <p>The entire middle east is treated as a military playground for US
  politicians so they can power move innocent people and be aroused by that
  feeling</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <p>The US has never tried any strategy in the middle east other than violence.</p>

  <p>They are so focused on themselves that they go around saying they are the
  greatest country in the world, all the time, without quite realizing that in
  fact that's technically an insult to the rest of us and we can hear them say
  it.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 14 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>Anyway I am hoping there are Americans who actually just agree with me
  rather than being offended.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 15 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>Alright the greatest country thing is not that bad, I do not actually care.</p>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 16 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>I think there will be a reckoning after this. I suspect those US dollars
  will probably not be able to be printed endlessly anymore by the US federal
  government. That will be a pretty significant shift in the world power
  dynamic.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 17 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>I think the key question is the level of automation. If the means of
  production is mostly automated, that means all the workers are just wasting
  their time and the true cost of most goods is actually near zero.  And so
  yeah you could just print money endlessly without prices going up since you
  can manufacture any amount for free.</p>

  <p>Whether or not the economy has reached some point like this, I have no
  idea. It depends on what percentage of the population is people pretending to
  work.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 19 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>Certainly I wish the US would aim that money hose at something else
  besides military spending. Like I seriously need to pay my rent, and so do
  many, many other people.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <span class="reply-header">Reply 20 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>And if you are one of those people pretending to work, I do not know what
  to tell you except I hope you feel really bad and I hope you want to find
  some way that I and others in my situation can avoid being evicted. You are
  getting paid to do nothing after all.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">

  <p>And my situation is that my employer believes they laid me off. I have
  been saying to people that they did not do it correctly and so it didn't
  count, which is possibly true so I have to keep saying that for legal
  reasons. Maybe they would reverse it and give me back pay if they changed
  their mind.</p>

  <p>I have in fact been working on stuff somewhat related to RapidSilicon. I
  bought a whole bunch of Arria 10s for projects. I want to use them to process
  sensor data from antennas. And also make an Xbox 360 emulator.</p>
</div>

<div class="reply2">
  <hr>
  <span class="reply-header">Reply 23 - Shane O'Connell</span>

  <p>I hope my comments about the attempted layoff situation with RapidSilicon
  do not count as speaking badly of a previous employer. I still like them I
  just wish I was receiving some income. And I think they really did not do it
  exactly correctly.</p>
