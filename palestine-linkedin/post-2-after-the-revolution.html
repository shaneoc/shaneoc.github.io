<h1>After the Revolution</h1>
<p><strong>Post Date:</strong> ~February 2024<br>
<strong>Original Post:</strong> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7165191788415184896-RF34/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a></p>
<!-- on 2024-05-30 it said this was posted 3 months ago -->

<div>2024-06-15</div>
<p>I originally called the second post &quot;New World Order&quot;. When I named it, I
felt it was just a cool way of referring to having a revolution. Then I
read this Wikipedia article:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)" target="_blank">New World Order (conspiracy
theory)</a></p>
<p>It appears the term sometimes refers to specific conspiracy theory about a
secretly emerging totalitarian world government. Since I was unaware of
this I found it somewhat alarming. I am not familiar with this specific
conspiracy theory.</p>
<p>At least, however, there is this use, also on Wikipedia:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_world_order_(politics)" target="_blank">New world order
(politics)</a></p>
<p>I renamed the post to &quot;After the Revolution&quot; just in case. It still makes
sense with that title.</p>
<p>My thinking on a revolution is pretty straightforward. Elsewhere on this
website I talked about printing a currency. I think we need some central
entity that manages and distributes a world currency in a fair way, so that
ethical incentives can be created.</p>
</div>
<p>Alright, I have been doing a lot of thinking about the new world order after
the revolution. I kinda want to give suggestions, but my understanding of
executive culture is that you are not supposed to admit when I am correct about
anything, which unfortunately means that you cannot solve problems when I point
them out.</p>
<p>I did want to point out one thing that occurred to me though. When you pay
someone a salary, they have an incentive to go slower, because the same task
done more slowly causes them to be paid more for the task. When you do not pay
someone any salary at all, however, they have an incentive to go faster
otherwise they will be evicted.</p>

<p>I just want a nice office like they got at the Google headquarters, with a
good team, and I am willing to go super slow on any task. Though honestly
I'm increasingly feeling like I want to choose all the tasks myself and
they should be for fun.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 2 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Well some things it would be difficult to go extremely slow because I will
want the thing itself, and sometimes it will be unethical to go slow. But
yeah other than that I want lots of time to sit on the couch and smoke
weed.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 3 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Also can I possibly have three girlfriends? I am afraid of seeming a bit
selfish, but I am thinking that we will be like a family and do stuff
together, and if it was only two girlfriends we could not easily play
tennis.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 4 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>In fact I am pretty sure my own subconscious specifically told me to ask
for three girlfriends. I am not sure why but I am supposed to ask for
three.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 5 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>And they must be biological women since these would be potential sexual
partners. However I do enjoy the idea of also doing engineering work with
them.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 6 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Alright maybe this is strange content for LinkedIn but I am kind of losing
my mind here in my apartment watching the news and realizing how the world
works.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 7 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Like do we have some kind of holy war going on that's part of the
subconscious world that is just now becoming apparent? Why are the US and
Israel purposefully starting a war?</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Reply 8 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Apparently the west is an evil warmongering place that has been tormenting
the middle east probably for religious reasons or for oil, and somehow I
thought it was just a difficult problem and everyone was trying their best
to solve it.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 9 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>The politicians from the west are going to the middle east just to keep the
politicians there under their control, rather than trying to solve anything</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 10 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>When engineers go slow to save their job, the product comes out later or is
more expensive. When politicians go slow to save their job, they drop bombs
and create society-wide problems on purpose.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 11 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>The entire middle east is treated as a military playground for US
politicians so they can power move innocent people and be aroused by that
feeling</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 12 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>The US has never tried any strategy in the middle east other than violence.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 13 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>They are so focused on themselves that they go around saying they are the
greatest country in the world, all the time, without quite realizing that
in fact that's technically an insult to the rest of us and we can hear them
say it.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 14 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Anyway I am hoping there are Americans who actually just agree with me
rather than being offended.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 15 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Alright the greatest country thing is not that bad, I do not actually care.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 16 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I think there will be a reckoning after this. I suspect those US dollars
will probably not be able to be printed endlessly anymore by the US federal
government. That will be a pretty significant shift in the world power
dynamic.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 17 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I think the key question is the level of automation. If the means of
production is mostly automated, that means all the workers are just wasting
their time and the true cost of most goods is actually near zero.  And so
yeah you could just print money endlessly without prices going up since you
can manufacture any amount for free.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 18 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Whether or not the economy has reached some point like this, I have no
idea. It depends on what percentage of the population is people pretending
to work.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 19 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>Certainly I wish the US would aim that money hose at something else besides
military spending. Like I seriously need to pay my rent, and so do many,
many other people.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 20 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>And if you are one of those people pretending to work, I do not know what
to tell you except I hope you feel really bad and I hope you want to find
some way that I and others in my situation can avoid being evicted. You are
getting paid to do nothing after all.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 21 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>And my situation is that my employer believes they laid me off. I have been
saying to people that they did not do it correctly and so it didn't count,
which is possibly true so I have to keep saying that for legal reasons.
Maybe they would reverse it and give me back pay if they changed their
mind.</p>

<p><strong>Reply 22 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I have in fact been working on stuff somewhat related to RapidSilicon. I
bought a whole bunch of Arria 10s for projects. I want to use them to
process sensor data from antennas. And also make an Xbox 360 emulator.</p>
</div>
<div class="reply2 reply">
<p><strong>Reply 23 - Shane O'Connell</strong></p>
<p>I hope my comments about the attempted layoff situation with RapidSilicon
do not count as speaking badly of a previous employer. I still like them I
just wish I was receiving some income. And I think they really did not do
it exactly correctly.</p>
