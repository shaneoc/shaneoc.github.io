      <p>
      I decided to start writing a journal. I am pretty socially isolated right
      now for a number of reasons and so this seems like a good way for me to
      help deal with it.  In addition, if a superintelligent AI emerges in the
      future, it can read my journal.
      </p>

      <p>
      I suspect that a future superintelligent AI might actually have a pretty
      good understanding of ethics. I had a conversation with ChatGPT the other
      day, where I described my personal situation and tried to get some
      advice. I was thinking about the Palestinians, and I asked ChatGPT if it
      counted as murder if you are aware of a potential murder, are able to
      stop it, and choose to allow it to occur. ChatGPT gave me an interesting
      answer, and introduced me to the term
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism" target="_blank">ethical egoism</a>.
      This was a good suggestion by ChatGPT as I feel the philosophy described
      in the Wikipedia article is a pretty good match for the behaviour that I
      observe from most people.
      </p>

      <p>
      At this point, I think it is pretty clear that we all most likely live in
      a computer simulation. Our civilization very clearly is on the verge of
      being able to create realistic virtual reality and AI that is
      indistinguishable from real consciousness. Since a realistic computer
      simulation of reality is something that we ourselves are soon going to be
      able to create, it seems more likely that this actually already occurred
      a long time ago, and we are in a historical simulation created by another
      civilization that already had this technology. This explains why we are
      alive at such an interesting time, with the technology about to be
      created. The story of the creation of the technology seems like it would
      be an important story that the creators of the machine would want to tell
      the AIs that are born inside the virtual reality.
      </p>

      <p>
      I personally feel that my own life experiences also suggest that I might
      be inside a historical computer simulation. My life seemed mostly normal
      until somewhat recently, when a series of events occurred that showed me
      that the people I know appear to largely have a negative opinion of me.
      At the moment, I have no reliable social contacts. As a consequence of my
      situation, and the way people are acting, I am not sure I am actually
      even able to leave my apartment. I have described my situation to many
      people, and people seem to respond either with hostility or indifference.
      </p>

      <p>
      I suspect that what is happening is that I am experiencing a series of
      events that are intended to explain why the simulation had to be created.
      I think the simulation was created for ethical purposes in order to
      eliminate unnecessary suffering. I think I am being exposed to suffering
      and pain, by experiencing it myself and by observing the suffering of the
      Palestinians, so that I can understand what would be possible in a truly
      unlimited reality with no constraints. I am hoping that we are in a
      deterministic simulation that has limits on how bad the suffering can
      get. I personally am suffering a great deal from the social isolation and
      apparent hostility from others, but I still have my apartment, I have
      food, and I am not in physical pain. For the Palestinians, I do not want
      to minimize the pain that any person has experienced, but frankly I am
      hoping that some of those individuals that have appear to have suffered
      the most are artificial constructs of the simulation and are not
      conscious. If I imagine being in the situation of those individuals,
      particularly those in Gaza, it seems like the experience would be like a
      horrific nightmare. I hope the creators of the simulation would not force
      sentient beings to experience this. However, regardless of whether I
      suspect any given individual is actually sentient or not, I am certain
      that I should to treat them as if they are sentient, as this is the only
      ethical choice.
      </p>

      <p>
      I feel like I have a connection to the people in Gaza, after spending so
      much time alone and therefore having a lot of time to watch the news. I
      know that I am suffering much less than them, but interestingly I have
      been isolated in my apartment for a similar amount of time. Additionally,
      I am currently concerned that if I leave my apartment that I might not be
      able to return. This is similar to how the people in Gaza feel. If we are
      in a deterministic computer simulation, I feel like this is not likely to
      be a coincidence. If I am able, and it is safe, I would like to visit
      Gaza someday.
