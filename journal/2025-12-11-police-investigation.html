<p>2025-12-11<br>
----------</p>
<p>I have memories of a few different things that happened to me that I want to
describe. These are memories of events that occurred around the time that the
police brought me to CAMH, which is a mental health facility in Toronto. I
described some of these events already in the <a href="2025-02-03-the-time-i-was-hacked.html">previous journal
entry</a>.</p>
<p>In my last entry I described that the YouTube user interface that I was using
on my computer appeared to be remotely controlled, and that the police brought
me to CAMH after I described the hack to them when they arrived at my
apartment. This is technically correct. However, these events did not all occur
in one day. There were multiple times that the YouTube interface seemed
suspicious to me, over multiple days. There were also other user interfaces on
my computer that seemed somewhat suspicious to me, including on my laptop.  In
particular, there were multiple times where the timing of certain things that
occurred on my computer seemed to line up with things that my friends and
family were saying to me. It was a vague feeling, but it was enough to be
noticeable. I started to become suspicious that maybe my computer was being
remotely monitored, and that somehow my friends and family had access to the
surveillance.</p>
<p>When the police eventually came to my apartment, it was because I had finally
gotten so concerned about what was happening on my computer that I had left the
apartment and tried to contact a neighbour and ask for help. However, this was
not the only time that I left the apartment out of concern about what was
happening. I also remember another time when I was so concerned that all I
wanted was to be in a public space where there were lots of people, so that if
I were physically attacked, there would be people around to ask for help. I was
so afraid of being physically attacked, that I brought a frying pan from my
kitchen with me. This sounds extreme, but it made sense to me at the time when
I was completely alone and very afraid. I went to a restaurant nearby that I
knew because they had a menu item that I liked. I sat in a booth by myself with
my frying pan, and had a meal.</p>
<p>Followed By People In Cars<br>
--------------------------</p>
<p>After the police brought me to CAMH without addressing the computer hack issue,
I returned home and was left with a problem. I still felt that my computer
might be hacked. In addition to that, I felt that the behaviour of the police
was strange. Aside from being upset, I had not said anything to them that would
indicate that I had a mental illness. It was clearly possible that my computer
actually was hacked, and even if it was not hacked, it was still possible for
things to occur by chance that made it appear that the computer had been
hacked. If those things occurred by chance, it was not possible for me to know
that, and so it was not a symptom of a mental illness to respond as if the
computer actually was hacked.</p>
<p>Some time after thinking about this, I left the building to go for a walk. This
was at least a few days after the CAMH visit, though I am not exactly sure how
much time passed between the two events. However, while I was on the walk, I
started to notice something strange. It seemed to me like a lot of the people
in the cars that passed by were looking at me while using headsets to talk on
the phone. It started to freak me out, so I started walking quickly and walking
down side streets at random to test to see if the people in the cars actually
were following me. It was hard to tell for sure, but the feeling that the
people in the cars were intentionally following me persisted.</p>
<p>Since I had encountered the police recently, I started to wonder if maybe the
people in the cars were the police, and that maybe they were now following me
after I chatted with them about my computer. It seemed possible that the police
might have been working together with whoever hacked my computer, and bringing
me to CAMH was a way of threatening me. I started to become concerned about
preserving evidence, so that I could later prove that my computer had been
hacked. My phone was one of the devices that I thought could have been hacked.
I decided to run and try to avoid the people that were following me, and I ran
into a park so that the cars could not easily follow. I turned off the phone
and hid it in the bushes, thinking that it would be safe in case I was
physically taken somewhere. I then ran back to my apartment after taking more
side streets.</p>
<p>The next day, I met up with my dad. I cannot remember if he was still in
Toronto from when he came for the CAMH visit, or if he had come back again for
another visit. In any case, I described some aspects of my experience of being
followed, though I am not sure how much detail I gave him. Since a day had
passed since it seemed like I had been followed, I was feeling a bit calmer,
and so I told my dad about my phone and that I wanted to get it back. We
decided to have a meal at a restaurant, and we stopped at the park on the way
to the restaurant. I went to the bushes where I had left the phone and I
successfully retrieved it. However, by chance, just as I entered the park and
walked towards my phone, I saw someone walking away from the area where my
phone was, holding a metal detector.</p>
<p>I felt seeing the person with a metal detector was a critical clue. The people
in cars on phones could have been a coincidence, however the odds of seeing a
person with a metal detector walk away from the area in the park where my phone
was, the very next day, entirely by chance, seemed unlikely, unless they were
specifically looking for my phone. If it was the police that were following me,
I wondered what they thought I was doing with my phone. I started to feel
suspicious that the police might now be investigating me for an unknown reason,
and I thought maybe my dad might be in on it, because I felt he was acting a
little bit strange as well. I made sure to specifically explain to my dad the
valid reason that I had for leaving my phone in the bushes, hoping that if it
was the police that were looking for my phone with the metal detector, that
being clear that I had a valid reason to leave it there would make them less
suspicious and would end the investigation.</p>
<p>Followed By People In A Grocery Store<br>
-------------------------------------</p>
<p>The problem of being concerned that the police might now be investigating me,
or even intentionally threatening me, persisted. When I was home by myself, I
would occasionally hear the police siren outside and I sometimes wondered if
they were intentionally doing it somewhere that I could hear them so that I
would feel intimidated. I thought about the two police officers that had taken
me to CAMH. I had spent hours at CAMH in the waiting area, chatting with these
two officers. For some reason, one of them told me a story about someone in
Toronto who had fallen from their balcony during a police arrest, and that the
police were being investigated about it. I was also told by one of the officers
about an extremely nice sounding cottage that they were able to afford outside
of the city. I became seriously concerned that the police officers might be
corrupt, and that maybe the references to falling from a balcony were a threat.</p>
<p>I became very concerned about computer security, and making sure that I
absolutely did not do anything illegal. I deleted all the copyrighted music and
movies on my computer that I had downloaded from file sharing networks when I
was younger. I kept trying to think of ways to improve the software on my
computer to make it more secure.</p>
<p>I also felt very unsure as to whether it was safer to hide in my apartment, or
hide in my car. In my apartment, I was afraid the police were going to come.
In my car, I was at a lower elevation, and I could escape a bad situation more
easily. However, I had nowhere to escape to, if I did want to escape.</p>
<p>At one point I went to a grocery store. When I was walking around the grocery
store, I felt very sure that I saw an above-average number of people using
headsets to talk on cellphones. I waved to one of the people on the headsets.
They did not wave back. It was nerve wracking.</p>
<p>Followed By People While Camping<br>
--------------------------------</p>
<p>I have one other significant memory of possibly being followed. In August 2022,
after a bunch of time had passed since the police brought me to CAMH, I had
started to feel calm again. I was planning a camping trip with some friends,
and I decided to book a campsite for two nights to camp by myself before my
friends arrived, after which I would meet my friends and we would do our group
trip. I planned to go canoeing during the day that I had by myself.</p>
<p>When the day came to switch campsites and meet my friends, I woke up early in
the day and had a beer. Normally, I am very strict about alcohol and I do not
drive at all for the rest of the day if I have any alcohol. However, in this
case it was extremely hard to resist. Sitting in nature at a campsite is a nice
place to have a beer. I had a lot of time left before I had to drive, and I
felt certain that I would be under the legal limit and that I would not feel
any of the effects by the time I was driving. Technically, I also only had to
drive for a few minutes from one campsite in the park to somewhere else in the
same park, which would make it even less risky, though I know that is not a
good excuse on its own. Regardless of whether you think it was a good idea, it
is what happened, so it is part of the story.</p>
<p>When the time came to actually get into the car and back out of the campsite,
however, I noticed another car come up and block my way out. I stopped and
waited. I then noticed a person walking towards me. I did not see if they came
from the other car, or if they came from somewhere else. They walked over to me
and started chatting with me. I do not recall what they said exactly. They did
not mention the beer that I had earlier in the day. However, it seemed to me
like the car was blocking my way intentionally, and the experience left me with
the distinct impression that I was being warned about having the beer. It was
an unnerving experience. After they left, I stayed parked at the campsite for
another hour or two to make absolutely sure it was obvious that I was sober,
and I drove to meet my friends at the second location.</p>
<p>It is possible that I was observing a group of private citizens that had
decided to warn me, or maybe they were totally innocent people who were not
trying to warn me at all. However, it was also possible that it was the police
in an unmarked vehicle. If it was the police, their behaviour was quite
strange. Technically speaking, I was almost certainly under the legal alcohol
limit, and so I technically was not violating the law, even though I understand
why someone could be concerned and in retrospect I probably should not have
consumed the beer. If I was being warned, I think their warning worked
successfully in that sense, in that it made me regret having the beer and I now
would not do the same thing again. However, at the same time, if they
intentionally warned me by making me feel like I was being followed, that
technically could be considered a violation of the law on <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/section-264.html" target="_blank">criminal
harassment</a>.
If they were the police, it seems like they probably should have identified
themselves.</p>
<p>Theory<br>
------</p>
<p>When I put these events together and try to create a theory to explain them, I
have a number of possibilities. For the forced CAMH visit, even though from my
perspective it did not make sense, it is possible that what happened was that
the police actually legitimately believed that I had a mental illness due to
the fact that I was emotional and upset when I spoke to them about my computer
being hacked. However, this would not explain why they would then decide to be
suspicious of me and follow me, if that is what they did.</p>
<p>To explain why the police might have believed I was suspicious, I have a
possible explanation. In more recent times, there have been things that have
happened that have left me with the impression that many of my family and
friends actually have a negative opinion of me, and may have had that opinion
for a long time without telling me. During the time I was at CAMH, the police
decided to contact my parents. If my parents actually had a negative opinion of
me at the time that they were keeping secret from me, it is possible that they
said things to the police that caused the police to believe that I was a
suspicious person, which led to them surveilling me. If this was the order of
events, it would explain most of what I experienced.</p>
<p>This order of events would mean that the police were not intentionally
threatening me when they brought me to CAMH. This does seem more likely to me.
However, the memories are technically ambiguous. If it turned out that the
police were trying to threaten me, that would fit what I observed as well.</p>
<p>At the time that these events occurred, I had another theory that I was
considering which significantly influenced my behaviour. I was suspicious that
perhaps the police might have been threatening me on behalf of business
executives that knew me from work. I plan to discuss this theory in a bit more
detail in a later journal entry.</p>
