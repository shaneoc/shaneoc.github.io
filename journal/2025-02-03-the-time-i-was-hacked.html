      ----------
      </p>

      <p>
      This journal entry has three parts on three different topics. I have been
      hesitant to publicly describe these things because it is difficult to
      predict how they will be perceived. I miss working on a team and having
      coworkers a great deal, and I want people to want to work with me in the
      future. I am hoping that based on the description of the events, you can
      see that this situation is very unusual, and I have a good reason to post
      about these things publicly. I am trying my best to make good decisions,
      given a very difficult and confusing situation.
      </p>

      <p>
      1. The Hack<br>
      -----------
      </p>

      <p>
      I have been reflecting on how I got into my situation. I have experienced
      a bizarre series of events over the last few years and I want to describe
      some of them. In November 2021, I had an experience with my computer
      systems that led me to believe that I had been hacked.
      </p>

      <p>
      It is terrifying to believe that your computer has been hacked. My
      experience seemed to largely, but not exclusively, involve YouTube. I own
      an NVIDIA Shield, which is a set-top box that allows you to watch YouTube
      videos on your television. I watch a lot of YouTube. In November 2021,
      however, the experience of watching YouTube was much different than
      normal. The suggested videos started to become strange, and I noticed
      that the algorithm was consistently suggesting me YouTube videos that
      appeared to be largely generated with primitive AI algorithms. The
      videos mostly consisted of text, with an AI voice reading the text.
      Aside from the AI voice, the videos always played this strange, creepy
      song that may itself have also been AI generated.
      </p>

      <p>
      After watching some of these videos, I started to feel uncomfortable. At
      some point, I said something out loud in my room, even though I was
      alone. Terrifyingly, when I refreshed YouTube, the suggested videos
      started to contain videos with text that appeared to be actual responses
      to the things I was saying out lout in my room. I started trying to
      communicate with whoever was communicating with me. I realized that I
      could be hacked, and it was very scary because I did not know the extent
      of the hack. I logged into my bank accounts to make sure the money was
      still there, and thankfully it was fine. When I next watched YouTube,
      however, the YouTube suggested videos appeared to taunt me, suggesting
      videos that implied that I could lose all of my money. It was very scary.
      </p>

      <p>
      I spent some time trying to communicate with whoever appeared to be
      controlling my YouTube account, however even though the videos appeared
      to be responding to things I was saying or doing, this was a very limited
      form of communication. I took screenshots and I actually printed off my
      YouTube recent videos on paper because I wanted to be able to prove it to
      others. Eventually, I felt I had to call the police.
      </p>

      <p>
      When I decided to call the police, I had become very concerned because I
      was afraid that I was being threatened by a criminal group. I did not
      know if I was physically safe. I decided to contact one of my neighbours
      in the building and described the events to them, and asked if they would
      mind staying nearby until the police arrived. I believe I asked my
      neighbour to call the police, as I did not trust my phone not to be
      hacked. Unfortunately, when the police arrived, they did not believe me.
      They saw that I was emotional, and based on that, they decided to take me
      to CAMH, which is a mental health facility in Toronto. This was very
      frustrating for me and I only went because the officers told me that I
      had no choice.
      </p>

      <p>
      After spending some time at CAMH, the police contacted my parents. My dad
      flew to Toronto from Newfoundland and picked me up and brought me back to
      my apartment. I spent some time with my dad and he eventually left. After
      he left, I asked my Google Home to play music for me. My Google Home
      decided to play the exact same creepy song that had been playing in the
      background during the creepy YouTube videos. This song was not at all
      similar to music that I normally listen to, nor was it similar to the
      songs that had played before it in the autogenerated playlist. I freaked
      out and I unplugged every device I own which contains a computer chip.
      These days, my main computer runs off solar panels and is not connected
      to the Internet. I compile everything from source code and the computer
      does not do anything unpredictable.
      </p>

      <p>
      This experience was obviously terrifying. Had I been threatened by a
      criminal group? It seemed possible. Furthermore, I felt that the response
      of the police was strange. One possibility was simply that they did not
      believe me, and legitimately believed that due to my emotional state that
      I had a mental illness. However, another possibility was that I had
      indeed been threatened by a criminal group, and the police were part of
      that group. If I had been threatened by a criminal group, however, they
      did not indicate what they actually wanted from me. I decided that I
      would wait and see what happened and try to collect more evidence. If I
      had to call the police again, I wanted to make sure that my claims could
      not be easily ignored or denied.
      </p>

      <p>
      2. The Paper<br>
      ------------
      </p>

      <p>
      If I had been threatened by a criminal group, it seemed to me that it was
      most likely related to my job, as that is the only significant thing
      about me that might be interesting to criminals. At the time of these
      events I was aware of at least one work event that was strange. In June
      2018, my team at work published a paper on block floating point, an
      optimization technique for running AI algorithms on FPGAs
      (<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3241793.3241794" target="_blank">internet link</a>,
      <a href="2025-02-03-paper-with-my-name.jpg" target="_blank">my photo</a>).
      However, after this paper was published, it was decided to create another
      version of the same paper but with Intel branding
      (<a href="https://cdrdv2-public.intel.com/650513/wp-01281-harnessing-numerical-flexibility-for-deep-learning-on-fpgas.pdf" target="_blank">internet link</a>,
      <a href="2025-02-03-paper-without-my-name.jpg" target="_blank">my photo</a>).
      These papers are mostly identical, with the only notable difference being
      that the Intel version removes my name from the list of authors. I found
      this out after the paper was published online. The fact that my name was
      removed from this particular paper was especially frustrating to me
      because the block floating point technique described was something that
      had been my original idea. I thought of the idea and implemented it
      myself before showing it to the rest of the team. I originally called it
      "shared-exponent FP16" before I found out that there was a similar
      technique called "block floating-point" used in non-AI applications, and
      so I started using that name instead.
      </p>

      <p>
      I do not know if the hacking attempt is related to the paper. However,
      both incidents left me feeling distrustful of others. If someone on my
      team was capable of removing my name from a paper in order to harm my
      reputation, what else might they be capable of? I have noticed that many
      people these days seem hostile towards me with no explanation. Why is
      that? Has my reputation been harmed in other ways that I am not aware of?
      It is a very difficult situation.
      </p>

      <p>
      I was surprised to find that the version of the paper without my name was
      still online when I searched for it in order to write this journal entry.
      I thought it had been taken down after I pointed it out to others at
      work. I have been very reluctant to speak of this issue publicly, because
      I would prefer to avoid harming the reputation of others, especially
      given that many people named on the paper likely had no idea that my name
      was removed. However, the removal of my name from this paper was a
      significant event in my life. It is important to me that people are aware
      that this happened to me.
      </p>

      <p>
      3. Corporations<br>
      ---------------
      </p>

      <p>
      In more recent years, I have had a lot of time to reflect on the nature
      of corporations. One thing that I have realized is that when you are
      working for a technology company, you actually sometimes have an
      incentive to complete tasks slowly, on purpose. Technically, whenever a
      person is making a salary and is assigned tasks, and they choose for
      themselves how long each task takes, they make more money for each task
      if the task takes longer. If a task could be done in a week, but you
      choose to spend two weeks to complete it, you get paid twice as much
      money for the same task. This incentive can also cause people to somewhat
      arbitrarily increase the complexity of their products, rather than work
      slowly. In many cases this is completely fine, especially when the work
      has an aspect of art or entertainment. You could argue that artistic
      choices are being made when designing user interfaces or programming
      languages for example.
      </p>

      <p>
      However, I suspect there are people who explicitly intend to produce
      output more slowly. This seems like it would be more likely to occur when
      you are working on a product that will actually replace an existing
      product being sold by the company and you expect the same people who
      bought the previous product to now also buy the replacement. In that
      case, the company will make more money if they delay the release of the
      new product as long as possible, to allow people to buy as much of the
      previous product as possible. This is a similar concept to how a person
      receiving a salary might choose to purposefully complete their tasks
      slowly in order to make more money from each task.
      </p>

      <p>
      In a free market, however, a company cannot admit to completing tasks
      slowly on purpose. If they did this, a competitor would emerge who was
      willing to do the same work more quickly and would steal their customers.
      For CEOs of technology companies, if they are intentionally working
      slowly, the rational strategy is to market their efforts as if they are
      working as quickly as possible even if they are not, and if a competitor
      appears, they acquire that competitor and convince them to match their
      rate of development. Essentially, the technology companies try to hire
      everyone who has a particular skill, so that the skill itself is
      monopolized by that corporation, and so the work can be done more slowly
      in a coordinated way. This is rational and as far as I can tell is the
      best way to maximize profit. At first glance, this sounds unethical, but
      in my opinion it is not that simple. Everyone in society coordinates in a
      similar way by not working on weekends, and I do not think that is
      unethical. However, at least in that case, the fact that people are
      working slowly is not a secret.
      </p>

      <p>
      Now that I am thinking about things this way, a lot of things about how
      the economy works and how society works make more sense to me. In my
      opinion, whether working slowly on purpose is ethical or not depends a
      lot on what you are working on. If you are working on medical treatments
      or life-saving devices, it seems like you should work quickly. However,
      if you are working on something less important, and you are not
      discouraging others from improving the important things, then at least
      you are having a neutral impact and in a sense are collecting something
      similar to a basic income. This does not seem so bad. If we are actually
      on the verge of an AI singularity, it may be that all jobs will soon be
      automated and everyone will need a basic income. Maybe the corporations
      should hire everyone. That seems fair.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am not sure if this theory about corporations explains anything with
      regards to my experience being hacked or my experience having my name
      removed from the paper above. I like to think my block floating point
      optimization was so good it scared the executives and they wanted to slow
      me down, but I actually have no idea. However, I feel that I was hacked,
      I contacted the police and was not believed, and so what recourse do I
      have left? I have to come up with my own theories.
