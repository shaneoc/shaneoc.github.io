      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The land between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea is
          disputed. Both the Israelis and the Palestinians wish to live there.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Historical Context</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The land is historically important and contains important religious
          sites for multiple major world religions.</li>
        <li>The current dispute began in the early 20th century when large numbers
          of Jewish people began to immigrate to the land in order to create a
          Jewish homeland. During this process, the existing occupants were
          partially displaced.</li>
        <li>The land is currently divided, with certain areas assigned to Israel
          and certain areas assigned to Palestine. The areas assigned to
          Palestine, however, are mostly under Israeli military control.</li>
        <li>The areas assigned to Palestine often contain illegal Israeli
          settlements, which further decrease the area available to Palestinians
          and make it difficult to create a contiguous region for Palestine.
          Preventing a contiguous region from being created appears to be one of
          the primary goals of the Israeli settlers.</li>
        <li>Israel controls the international border between Palestine and
          Jordan, as well as the international border between Palestine and
          Egypt.</li>
        <li>Israel has historically been supported by large cash transfers from
          the United States to support its economy and military while Palestine
          has not received the same support.</li>
        <li>The economies of Israel and Palestine are tightly linked. Many
          Palestinians travel to and trade with Israel for work. Palestinians do
          not have their own currency and use the Israeli shekel as one of their
          main currencies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Observations</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Israel effectively treats the Palestinian territories as if they were
          already part of Israel, and it seems clear that their eventual goal is
          to eventually integrate all of the Palestinian territories into Israel.
          This is clear from the actions of the Israeli settlers, the control of
          the external borders of Palestine with other countries, as well as
          statements from Israeli politicians themselves.</li>
        <li>If a separate Palestinian state were created, it would be very small.
          If this state tried to become independent of the Israeli economy, the
          people in that state would end up spending a lot of time and effort
          maintaining duplicate versions of Israeli businesses. Since the state
          would be small, there may not be very much productive capacity left
          over to do very many unique or interesting things besides duplicating
          these businesses.</li>
        <li>The US government currently sends Israel large amounts of money in
          order to support the Israeli military. The Israeli economy depends on
          receiving this money to pay salaries, and so ending these transfers
          could have a significantly negative economic impact. However, it might
          be possible to transition the payments to be for some other purpose
          besides the military rather than ending them, in order to reduce the
          economic impact.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Discussion</h2>

      <p>This conflict has been around for a long time, with most people who
      run the state of Israel today not having been around when the state was
      created. The method by which the state was formed, by using force,
      appears to have been more common in the past. European settlers used
      violence and force to create most or all of the countries in the
      Americas, including the United States and Canada, as well as Australia
      and various other countries around the world.</p>

      <p>It appears that in the case of Israel, as compared to other western
      countries that were formed by settlers taking land by force, the process
      of colonization is simply incomplete. Many of the violent things that we
      see Israel do to the Palestinians today are likely similar to the violent
      things that would have occurred to native Americans when European
      colonists first arrived.</p>

      <p>While it is true the state was formed by force, it is however
      important to differentiate between the motives of Jewish settlers that
      arrived early in the 20th century and the motives of the state of Israel
      today. Early Jewish settlers had permission from the Ottoman Empire to
      move there and many were escaping persecution from their home countries.
      The state of Israel today, however, is much different, and appears to be
      much more motivated in its actions by internal politics and receiving
      large incentives in the form of United States military aid.</p>

      <h3>Possible Solutions</h3>

      <p>In order to solve the issues in Israel and Palestine, we need to list
      all of the possible options, and then choose the best option. Here is a
      list to start with:</p>

      <dl>
        <dt>Two-State Solution</dt>
        <dd>Israel and Palestine remain separate countries.</dd>
        <dt>One-State Solution</dt>
        <dd>Israel and Palestine merge into one country.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>In order to understand these options, we have to think about what it
      means for a country to exist. Many people use the word without having
      precise definition, and simply have an idea of what the word means from
      knowing many examples. It usually refers to a geographic area with its
      own government, and which sometimes, but not always, has its own
      currency, language, and culture. The definition of country also often
      overlaps with the definition of nation, which often refers to a similar
      thing but usually seems more focused on the common culture rather than
      the common geography.</p>

      <p>The reality, however, is that the words country and nation can mean
      whatever we want them to mean. Many people would argue that the countries
      of Europe are in many ways more like constituent regions of a federal
      European Union, rather than independent countries. We still call them
      countries, however, because people want them to be countries.</p>

      <p>If it is true, then, that the definitions of country and nation are
      flexible, and that many arbitrary things can be called a country or a
      nation, then the difference between a one-state solution and a two-state
      solution is actually itself somewhat fuzzy and hard to define. It is
      possible for a single state to contain two constituent cultures, and it
      is also possible for two separate states to share almost all government
      functions. Therefore, it seems like the best approach is to initially
      disregard the issue of how the solution is described and instead focus
      creating the best governance system for the region, regardless of whether
      the resulting entity is classified as containing one state or two
      states.</p>

      <h3>Restating the Problem</h3>

      </figure>

      <p>If the distinction between one state and two states is fuzzy and
      either solution could really mean anything, then we need a different way
      to describe the problem so that we can discuss actual solutions.  We
      can group the decisions and trade-offs into categories:

      <dl>
        <dt>Economic Issues</dt>
        <dd>The economies of Israel and Palestine can be tightly integrated,
          with supply chains frequently crossing the boundary between them, or
          they can be separate, with businesses being duplicated to create a
          version of each business in each country. These are issues that
          generally relate to employment and jobs.</dd>
        <dt>Cultural Issues</dt>
        <dd>The cultures of Israel and Palestine are currently distinct in many
          ways, using different languages and having a different religion. Many
          people in each culture value these differences from the other
          culture. Efforts can be taken to preserve these differences, while
          also encouraging the groups to interact so that they have more
          positive feelings towards each other. In general these issues relate
          to people's emotions and ego, and attachment to their culture.
        </dd>
        <dt>
      </dl>

      <p>Describing these issues in detail is beyond the scope of what I am
      trying to accomplish with this particular webpage. However, I believe
      there are some general themes that are likely to be part any solution,
      or at least any peaceful solution.</p>

      <h3>Outline of a Solution</h3>

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <dl>
        <dt>Common Currency</dt>
        <dd>Israel and Palestine already have tightly-linked economies, with
          the Palestinians already using the Israeli currency as one of their
          main currencies. It makes sense for this to continue, though the
          currency should be managed so that the needs of both Israel and
          Palestine are addressed in a fair way.</dd>
        <dt>Free Movement</dt>
        <dd>Gaza is a very small region to be surrounded by a wall. The West
          Bank is larger, but Israeli settlers have already purposefully placed
          their settlements in order to make it difficult to create a
          contiguous state for the Palestinians. In the long term, it is
          difficult to see how these walls are not eventually going to come
          down for practical reasons. It is possible to allow free movement of
          Israelis and Palestinians over the whole territory while still having
          other restrictions that prevent local regions from losing their
          Jewish or Muslim character.</dd>
        <dt>Common Parliament</dt>
        <dd>A government is required in order to manage a common currency and a
          common external border. This should be a representative government
          that includes both Israelis and Palestinians. There can optionally be
          additional regional governments that due to their geographic location
          would tend to either be more Israeli or Palestinian.</dd>
        <dt>Replacement of United States Military Aid</dt>
        <dd>The Israeli economy is very dependant on the economic benefits of
          receiving billions of dollars from the United States in order to
          support its military. If there truly is peace, then we should expect
          that this level of military spending is no longer necessary. In order
          to encourage other parts of the economy to develop, much of this
          spending should be redirected to be spent on non-military parts of
          the economy. In particular, spending money on a space industry seems
          like a good idea given that there is a lot of overlap between the
          military and space industry in terms of skills required, especially
          engineering skills.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p>I think the above list represents a reasonable solution that I suspect
      is somewhat inevitable anyway. An additional optional suggestion that I
      would make that is less inevitable, but still a good idea in my opinion,
      would be to build high speed rail lines linking Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and
      Gaza such that they are all directly connected to each other. This could
      be a symbolic peace project that everyone could be proud of and look
      forward to using.</p>
