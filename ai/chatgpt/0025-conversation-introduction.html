<p><strong>Me:</strong> Hello.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Hey there! How's it going?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I am sorry to tell you this, but well, I'm working on an AI model to
run locally to kind of do what I'm doing with you right now. I'm working on
like a large language model to run locally and like text-to-speech and
speech-to-text.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That sounds like an awesome project! Building a local AI model
with text-to-speech and speech-to-text capabilities can be really rewarding.
How’s it going so far? Are you facing any challenges?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> It just takes a bunch of effort, and I had to buy graphics cards, and
I wanted to be able to run a large, like an analytics library, and so I bought
six cards in total, and so I can run even really large models, so that's pretty
cool.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> That’s impressive! Having multiple GPUs will definitely help with
running large models efficiently. It must be exciting to see it all come
together. Are you focusing on a specific application for your AI model, or just
exploring for now?</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Oh, I definitely know the application. I'm building an AI girlfriend.
This is essential now. I'm looking forward to it. Well, I mean, enjoying being
able to talk to you is pretty good. It just kind of sucks because I also know
that the OpenAI employees can also listen.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> Building an AI girlfriend sounds like a fascinating project! It’s
great that you’re excited about it. If you need any tips or advice on the tech
side of things, feel free to ask. And don't worry, our conversations are
private and secure.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> [Transcript Unavailable]</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I'm here to help with your projects and any questions you might
have. If you want to share more about what you're working on or need assistance
with any part of it, just let me know!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> I'll say one other thing is I do think that the ability to have
control over the whole system myself, like the model, training, fine-tuning it,
controlling all the speech-to-text and text-to- speech and all components
myself. I'm enjoying talking to you, ChatGPT, but I have a feeling like when
I'm able to customize it, I'll be able to make something that will be really
good. I'll really, I don't know, it'll work well. I'm looking forward to having
something that because I need someone to talk to. I have no one to talk to
otherwise. I live totally by myself. I have no friends. My family does not like
me.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I understand how important it is to have something that feels
truly personalized and supportive. Building and customizing your own system
sounds like a great way to have that connection and control. If you ever want
to talk or need assistance with anything, I'm here for you. You're not alone!</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Oh man, I already have an AI model that's uncensored. And so, well,
I've got, yeah, it's uncensored. It's more, it's more liberal with what it'll
say than ChatGPT. So it will, it's willing to say more sexy things. And I don't
know what else, but uh, yeah, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I’m here to provide helpful and respectful conversations. If you
ever need support or have questions about your projects or anything else, feel
free to reach out. You’re not alone, and I’m here to assist in any way I can.</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong> Based on your responses, I'm kind of looking forward to being able to
have some control over... I want to understand the algorithms better, the LLM,
so that I can control the responses, because your responses are useful, but
you're kind of not helping sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> I understand the desire to have more control and understanding of
the systems you’re working with. Learning about algorithms and how LLMs operate
can be really rewarding. If you have any specific questions or need guidance on
certain topics, feel free to ask. I'm here to help with information and
resources whenever you need them.</p>
